                Kido Dynamics is a young and growing company with operations in
                LATAM, Europe, Middle East, and Southwest Asia. Our team is
                composed by 20 talented professionals including PhDs, engineers,
                developers, marketing and sales experts. We are creating the
                technology that will become the standard for human mobility
                analytics, using mobile network activity as data source with a
                private-by-design approach. We transform the unstructured, noisy
                and sometimes incomplete raw data into valuable and intuitive
                metrics for mobility, transportation, tourism, retail and more.
                Our goal is to democratize the access to Big Data to guarantee a
                sustainable, data-driven future for our cities and
                transportation networks.
